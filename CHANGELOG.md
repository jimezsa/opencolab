# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project follows Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Telegram now supports `/stop` for cancelling the active routed task in the same chat or topic, saving a compact recovery summary in session memory so a later turn can resume from the last known stage.

### Changed

- Routed provider execution now exposes a gateway-owned cancellation path so stopped Telegram runs close live status cleanly, suppress stale late replies, and avoid appending cancelled partial output as a finished assistant answer.
- Telegram long polling now dispatches consumed updates without waiting for the previous routed run to finish, so `/stop` can interrupt an in-flight task instead of being blocked behind it.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- Built-in `pi`-backed provider support for `openrouter` and `kimi`, including `opencolab setup model`, `ignite` onboarding, runtime env wiring for `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `KIMI_API_KEY`, and the upstream `kimi-coding` provider mapping used by `pi`.
- A shared `autoresearch` skill plus a built-in `autoresearch` specialist template for iterative keep/discard experiment loops over one explicitly configured repo, with explicit repo contract requirements, disposable branch/worktree guidance, and default ownership of sustained experiment-loop work by the `autoresearch` agent.

### Changed

- OpenAI defaults and onboarding examples now use `gpt-5.4`, and the OpenRouter OpenAI example now uses `openai/gpt-5.4`.
- `ignite` onboarding and `opencolab setup model` now expose native reasoning-effort selection for supported models, currently including OpenAI `gpt-5.4` (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`) and Anthropic Claude on the Claude runtime (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`).
- Shared workflow and template docs now mention `autoresearch` alongside the other built-in shared skills, and the README inspiration list now includes `karpathy/autoresearch`.
- Professor-facing built-in staffing guidance now explicitly calls out `opencolab agent create --agent-id autoresearch` when a project needs a dedicated owner for sustained experiment-loop work.
- The shared `runpod-job` guidance now defaults to a user-managed Runpod Pod workflow where the human creates the Pod, provides the `pod_id`, and the agent uses direct SSH, while keeping the OpenColab-managed `gpu server` and `gpu job` lifecycle as an explicit opt-in for `run_id`-tracked work.
- Telegram management from paired chats now centers on `/projects`, `/agents`, and `/session_reset`, with picker-based project and agent selection and session reset remaining available while project and agent creation stay CLI-driven.
- Telegram live status now waits for real runtime progress before creating a status surface, keeps private chats compact, and streams a bounded recent tool-activity list through one editable message in groups.
- Telegram live status now marks the newest visible step with `🟢` and older still-visible steps with `⚪` so the active step is easier to spot while a run is streaming.
- Routed Telegram text replies are now prefixed with the active agent id on the first line so one Telegram chat can distinguish which agent answered without polluting conversation memory.
- Routed Codex runs now normalize nested `item.*` lifecycle events and `turn.completed` into user-facing Telegram live status text instead of leaking raw protocol names such as `item.started`.
- Routed Claude Code runs now use the current `claude -p --verbose --output-format stream-json` contract so Telegram live status continues to work with newer Claude Code releases.
- Existing saved Claude-runtime provider configs on recognized older default arg sets now auto-migrate to the current streaming contract when OpenColab loads state, so upgraded installs recover Telegram live status without requiring manual model reconfiguration.
- Anthropic native reasoning flags are now inserted before the Claude CLI `-- <prompt>` separator so reasoning-effort settings do not break current Claude runtime invocation.
- Telegram final text replies are now split into ordered chunks before hitting the Bot API text limit, preserve active group topic routing, and log Telegram API status and descriptions when delivery fails instead of dropping oversized replies silently.

### Removed

- Telegram support for the older `/project ...`, `/agent ...`, and `/session reset` text command families, along with the older slash-menu aliases such as `/project_create`.
- The shared `fast-search`, `pro-search`, and `deep-search` skill docs no longer call out optional `PAPERCLI_SEMANTIC_API_KEY` and `PAPERCLI_SERPAPI_KEY` prerequisites.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- New/default Runpod execution targets and the `ignite` curated Runpod preset now default to the `keep_warm` auto-stop policy.
- The shared `runpod-job` workflow guidance now defaults to `NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe`, uses `keep_warm`, and requires agents to ask whether a warm Pod should keep running after a terminal-backed run completes.
- One-link installer-managed installs now persist managed install metadata so `opencolab upgrade` can upgrade both installer-managed package installs and `--hacky` installer-managed clone installs through the same CLI entrypoint.
- Packaged installs now keep using the platform runtime root when `OPENCOLAB_ROOT` is unset instead of letting stray cwd-local `opencolab.json` or `.env.local` files silently hijack the runtime root.
- The shell and PowerShell one-link installers now warn when another `opencolab` command appears earlier on `PATH` than the installer-managed shim.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-31

### Changed

- Routed provider runs that hit `OPENCOLAB_PROVIDER_CLI_TIMEOUT_MS` now preserve the inbound user request and append a compact recovery note to the active session memory, so the next turn can resume from the last known stage instead of starting cold.
- The shared `runpod-job` workflow guidance now requires detached-only launches with `--wait false` for every Runpod job, returns the `run_id` promptly for later inspection, refreshes local log snapshots with `opencolab gpu job status` before reporting on a run, and reviews `bootstrap`, `stdout`, `stderr`, and `poller` when summarizing outcomes.
- Telegram now exposes `/projects` and `/agents` picker commands that return inline buttons, and the gateway can process callback-query taps to switch the active project or agent without requiring typed ids.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- `opencolab gpu server availability --server-id <id>` now reports a live Runpod datacenter and GPU capacity snapshot for one configured target before launch.
- `opencolab gpu job exec --run-id <id> --command "<command>"` now runs one bounded remote command over the launched Runpod Pod SSH path and returns `runId`, `targetId`, `exitCode`, `stdout`, and `stderr`.

### Changed

- Bare `opencolab` help now shows the installed CLI version immediately, and `opencolab --version` / `opencolab version` print it directly.
- New/default Runpod execution targets and the `ignite` curated Runpod preset now default to the `pytorch-cu12` bootstrap profile instead of `python-ml`.
- The shared `runpod-job` workflow guidance now prefers detached launch with `--wait false` for longer jobs, returns the `run_id` promptly for later inspection, and requires failed or degraded runs to be surfaced with a clear next action.
- Runpod availability checks now surface the best current datacenter and GPU match, preserve configured fallback order, and warn about Pod-API-incompatible datacenters or known storage-provisioning failures.
- Runpod provisioning now falls back cleanly across preferred datacenters when per-location network-volume creation fails, and normalizes shorthand GPU names to the canonical Runpod GPU ids required by Pod creation.
- The shared `runpod-job` skill now teaches agents to run live availability checks before launch when stock matters, treat availability as a snapshot rather than a reservation, and distinguish launch failures from slower remote bootstrap work after SSH is already available.
- The shared `runpod-job` workflow and built-in agent guidance now teach agents to use `gpu job exec` for bounded direct Pod inspection instead of exposing raw SSH details.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Packaged installs now default their runtime root to `~/.opencolab` on macOS/Linux or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenColab\root` on Windows when `OPENCOLAB_ROOT` is unset, instead of falling back to the caller's current working directory.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- npm package metadata now links the published package back to the GitHub repository, issue tracker, and changelog.

### Changed

- Provider CLI execution now defaults to a 30 minute timeout instead of 10 minutes and remains configurable via `OPENCOLAB_PROVIDER_CLI_TIMEOUT_MS`.

### Removed

- Legacy support for the `OPENCOLAB_CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS` timeout env var.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Windows PowerShell one-link installer support via `install.ps1`.
- Optional `--hacky` git-clone fallback mode for the one-link installers when the desired npm package version is unavailable.
- Project-scoped `PROJECT-AND-TEAM.md` shared context seeded for new/default projects and loaded into every agent prompt.
- Professor-led specialist creation guidance, including explicit `opencolab agent create --agent-id <id>` and per-agent `opencolab setup model --agent-id <id> ...` workflow references.

### Changed

- `install.sh` now fails fast on Windows and directs users to the PowerShell installer.
- Seeded agent startup guidance now requires reading `BOOTSTRAP.md` before `ALMA.md` while bootstrap still exists, preventing first-contact identity setup from being skipped.
- Seeded agent instructions now treat `PROJECT-AND-TEAM.md` as the canonical shared project context and require agents to follow its maintenance rules before editing it.
- Prompt construction now loads shared project context after `TODO.md` and before agent-local `MEMORY.md`.
- Seeded professor guidance now treats specialist hiring as a normal lead-agent responsibility with human approval, while specialist and beginner agents route staffing recommendations back through professor by default.
- `PROJECT-AND-TEAM.md` now supports recording agent roster status such as proposed, created, configured, active, paused, or archived when it matters to the project.
